Stock News Monitor
This is a simple command-line tool that monitors a stock's intraday price movements. When the price changes by more than a specified threshold (e.g., 5%), it fetches and displays the latest news headlines related to that company. This is designed to help traders and investors quickly spot why a stock might be moving significantly.

Features
Monitors a single stock by its ticker symbol.

Uses a real-time stock price API to check for price fluctuations.

Uses a news API to get relevant headlines.

The price change threshold is easily configurable.

Setup
Get API Keys: You will need API keys from a stock price provider and a news provider.

Stock Price API: We recommend using a service like Alpha Vantage or Finnhub.

News API: We recommend using a service like NewsAPI.org.

Install Dependencies: This project requires the requests library to make HTTP calls to the APIs.

pip install requests

Configure API Keys: Create a file named config.py in the same directory as the main script and add your API keys there. Do not commit this file to a public repository.

# config.py
STOCK_API_KEY = "YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY"
NEWS_API_KEY = "YOUR_NEWSAPI_ORG_API_KEY"

Usage
Run the main script from your terminal, providing the ticker symbol and monitoring interval in seconds.

python stock_monitor.py AAPL

You can optionally specify the monitoring interval in seconds and the price threshold:

python stock_monitor.py TSLA --interval 300 --threshold 7

Disclaimer
This is a simplified tool for educational purposes. It uses free API tiers which may have rate limits. The price and news data are provided by third-party services and may not be suitable for live trading decisions.
